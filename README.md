# Fireboy-and-watergirl-bot

# About

This project is a bot that will play as either Fireboy or Watergirl, with a human player, so the player does not have to be all alone anymore :')

The entire bot will be coded using the Python programming language, and all of the code will be right here in this repository.

# Features

Bot should be able to recognise the basic dangers and elements of the level, such as 

- Opposing Liquids
- Green liquids
- Buttons and Levers
- The goal


## Voice Recognition
For (Hopeful) ease of use, I will be making use of voice recognition, in order to give the bot commands.

## Different Modes
As Fireboy and Watergirl is also a strategy game and has different modes, the bot should be able to react accordingly.

### Sync
Certain levels require both players to move at the same time, as such, the bot should be able to match the movements of the player exactly.

### Reverse Sync
Other levels, require both players to move in sync... but in opposite directions, and as such, the bot should be able to handle these as well.

### Roam
Bot should be able to make it's own way to the goal... Hopefully XD

### Switch
Whether because the player wishes to play as the other character, or simply wishes to help out the bot in a tight spot.

### Listen and Deafen
As with any software that uses Voice Recognition, it should be toggleable.
